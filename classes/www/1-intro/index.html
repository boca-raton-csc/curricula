      <h1>Welcome to the Web&mdash;Introduction</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Internet â‰  Web</h2>

      <p>Rather, the Web uses the Internet.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>The Internet</dt>
        <dd>A global system of computer networks.</dd>
        <dt>The Web</dt>
        <dd>A giant ecosystem of linked documents accessible via the internet.</dd>
        <dt>Website</dt>
        <dd>A set of related web documents found on one web domain.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>This course is designed to teach you how to create documents and put them on the web.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>This is one Such Document</h2>

      <p>By the end of the course you <em>will</em> be able to take this entire presentation and understand how it was made.</p>
      <p>Then you will be ready to go out in the world and build your own web pages/apps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>The Problems Facing the Web Today</h2>

      <p>We will start off the course by talking about challenges that the web faces <em>today</em>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Refrigerators</li>
        <li>Web vs. Native</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Refrigerators</h3>

      <p>Soon almost everything will be able to access the Web (including your refrigerator). Here are a few things that already can access the web:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Computers</li>
        <li>Phones</li>
        <li>Cars</li>
        <li>Watches</li>
        <li>Televisions</li>
        <li>Robots</li>
        <li>Gaming Consoles</li>
      </ul>

      <p>...And each device has it's own limitations.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Crude input device (Television, Gaming consoles)</li>
        <li>Tiny screens (Phone, Watch)</li>
        <li>No screens! (Robots)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide slide-img">
      <img src="images/devices.jpg" alt="A whole lot of devices">
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>The Solution!</h4>

      <p>As developers we must design content for the web that will work on <em>any</em> device. Known <em>and</em> unknown.</p>
      <p>Two fields in the industry that specifically work towards combating this problem are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Accessibility</dt>
        <dd>Makes sure people with disabilities (like blindness or motor disease) are able to completely access the website. Their work is also useful for devices without a screen which impose a pseudo-blindness.</dd>
        <dt>Responsive Design</dt>
        <dd>Work towards making sure site designs look good at any screen size/resolution/connection speed.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Web vs. Native</h3>

      <p>There is a huge conversation in the industry over which is better, web or native?</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>The Web</dt>
        <dd>You beautiful people don't need the same definition twice ;)</dd>
        <dt>Native</dt>
        <dd>Any code written for specific hardware. This is code that only runs on a certain platform. For example, a video game developer must build his or her game for XBox, PlayStation, a Computer, etc.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Standards</h3>

      <p>In order for the web to work on <em>any</em> hardware, a standards organization called W3 was formed.</p>
      <p>This body decides how all the code should work and then each platform (iPhone, Laptop, Refrigerator, XBox) create their own implementation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>So which is better?</h3>

      <p><strong>Neither</strong>. Both platforms have their advantages, and when selecting one it all comes down to what the project needs, and what you prefer.</p>

      <h4>Native advantages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster (but arguably marginally so)</li>
        <li>Opinionated</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Web advantages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Works <em>anywhere</em></li>
        <li>Unopinionated</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

      <p>Browsers take our code and render it for the user, there are many different browsers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Chrome</li>
        <li>Safari</li>
        <li>Opera</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer...</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>Browser Wars</h4>

      <p>Browsers are always in competition for who can have the largest number of users. It used to be browsers would get more users depending on how many fancy features no one else had. Can you see the problem in that mindset?</p>
      <p>There were many problems. Browsers would add new features, but with different syntaxes. Or browsers would add new features and call it something completely different from other browsers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>Ambiguity</h4>

      <p>One such example is the following. If a developer wrote:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>height: 50px</code>
      </pre>

      <p>That code would mean one thing in one browser and a completely different thing in another!</p>
      <p>People had to create completely different websites for different browsers. That is a <em>very</em> bad thing considering the goal of the web is to write code that works everywhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>The Solution</h4>

      <p>The standards we talked about earlier. The reason no one likes Internet Explorer is because for the longest time they were <em>terrible</em> at implementing the latest standards in a timely fashion. More recently the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft has gotten a lot better at keeping their browser up to date.</p>
      <p>Now the winner of the browser wars is the one who can implement new standards the fastest and most accurately. This is great news for developers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>So Here we are Today...</h2>

      <p>The world wide web is history's largest historical disruptor, bigger than the Mongols, bigger than the printing press. Throughout time nothing has given individuals the ability to distribute their ideas like the web.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to use the web technologies to better our lives and the lives of others by making awesome things.</p>

      <p><code>&lt;/lesson&gt;</code></p>
