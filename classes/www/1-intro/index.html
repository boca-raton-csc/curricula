      <h1>Welcome to the Web&mdash;Introduction</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Internet â‰  Web</h2>

      <p>Rather, the Web uses the Internet.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>The Internet</dt>
        <dd>A global system of computer networks.</dd>
        <dt>The Web</dt>
        <dd>A giant ecosystem of linked documents accessable via the internet.</dd>
        <dt>Website</dt>
        <dd>A set of related web documents found on one web domain.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>This course is designed to teach you how to create documents and put them on the web.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>This is one Such Document</h2>

      <p>By the end of the course you should be able to take this entire presentation and understand how it was made.</p>
      <p>That's pretty awesome if you ask me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>The Problems Facing the Web Today</h2>

      <p>We will start of the course with some history and background information of the web.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Refrigerators</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Refrigerators</h3>

      <p>Soon almost everything will be able to access the Web (like your refrigerator). Here are a few things that already let you access the web:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Computers</li>
        <li>Phone</li>
        <li>Car</li>
        <li>Watch</li>
        <li>Television</li>
        <li>Robots</li>
        <li>Gaming Consoles</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <!-- <img src="images/devices.jpg" alt="A whole lot of devices"/> -->
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>The Solution!</h4>

      <p>Each device that can access the web has it's own limitations.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Crude input device (Television, Gaming consoles)</li>
        <li>Tiny screens (Phone, Watch)</li>
        <li>No screens! (Robots)</li>
        <li>On and on and on...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As computer scientists we must design content for the web that will work on <em>any</em> device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

      <p>The other problem...</p>
      <p>Browsers take our code and render it for the user, and there are many different browsers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Chrome</li>
        <li>Safari</li>
        <li>Opera</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer...</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>Browser Wars</h4>

      <p>Browsers are always in competition for who can have the larges amount of users. It used to be browsers would get more users depending on how many fancy features they had.</p>
      <p>There were many problems with that. Browsers would add new features, but with different syntaxes. Or browsers would add new features and call it something completely different from other browsers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slides">
      <h4>Ambiguity</h4>

      <p>One such example is the following. If a developer wrote:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>height: 50px</code>
      </pre>

      <p>That code would mean one thing in one browser and a completely different thing in another!</p>

      <p>People had to create completely different websites for different browsers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slides">
      <h4>The Solution</h4>

      <p>Standards. A group called the W3C created a set of standards defining what features should be implemented by browsers and the exact syntax.</p>

      <p>After a lot of work these standards were adopted by all browsers.</p>

      <p>Now the winner of the browser wars is the one who can implement new standards the fastest and most accurately. This is great news for developers.</p>
