  <h3>A Case for JavaScript</h3>

  <p>If you have any programming experience, you likely have an opinion about JavaScript. Here is why we chose to teach JavaScript over other languages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript can run no matter the operating system as long as a browser is installed.</li>
    <li>Everything is an object.</li>
    <li>Extremely flexible, can emulate syntaxes from many languages.</li>
    <li>Weak typed programming languages are typically easier for beginners.</li>
    <li>Constantly being updated (ES2015, ES2016).</li>
    <li>Node.js is awesome.</li>
    <li><strong>HUGE</strong> community of open source libraries (NPM).</li>
    <li>It's fun (opinion).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>More important then the language is we will be teaching you how to <em>think</em> like a computer scientist. After that you should have the tools to go and learn whatever language you want.</p>
