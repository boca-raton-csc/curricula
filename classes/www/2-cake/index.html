      <h2>The Web is a Platform</h2>

      <p>There is <em>not one programming language</em> that makes up the web. Rather a collection of different technologies. Primarily, but not exclusively:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML: content</li>
        <li>CSS: styles</li>
        <li>JavaScript: interactivity</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Advantages</h2>

      <p>This allows developers to seperate concerns and specialize in what they enjoy.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</h2>

      <p>HTML is boring. It's drab and grey like concrete. However, also like concrete HTML is the most important part of what you build because it is the foundation.</p>

      <p>Without good HTML it is <em>very hard to get everything else right</em>.</p>

      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
    &lt;script src="script.css"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    Content
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

      <p>CSS is easy to learn, but <em>very</em> hard to master.</p>

      <p>CSS is what makes pages look pretty. It adds color, sizing, does layout and much much more. The trickiness is because CSS is a highly declarative language. If you don't have <em>all</em> the declerations memorized and know about their interactions it is hard to wrap your head around.</p>

      <p>For most of this course we will use open source css libraries that manage our stylesheets for us.</p>

      <p>If you want to learn CSS we will be excited to teach you, our worry is that the majority of people don't want/need CSS knowledge.</p>
    </div>

    <aside class="slide">
      <h3>Example</h3>

      <pre>
body {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: baseline;
  margin: 1rem 0;
  padding: 1rem;
  width: 80vw;
  min-width: 200px;
  max-width: 5000px;
  background-color: tomato;
  font-family: "Comic Sans", sans-serif;
  text-align: justify;
}
      </pre>
    </aside>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <p>JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It is an object oriented, weak typed, functional programming language with prototypal inheritance (although classical inheritance can be faked and eventually will be implemented in ES6).</p>

      <p>The word JavaScript is synonymous with ECMAScript. We will be teaching ES5 (ECMAScript 5). Even though ES6/ES2015 and eventually ES7/ES2016 are the cutting edge of JavaScript development, they do not have good support in major browsers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Example</h3>

      <pre>
Session.setDefault("kayla", true);

Template.discussion.helpers({
  messages: function() {
    var discussion = Zorbs.findOne(Session.get('discussionId'));
    return discussion.messages;
  },

  featuredMessages: function () {
    var discussion = Zorbs.findOne(Session.get('discussionId'));
    var messages = discussion.messages.filter(function (message) {
      return message.likes.length >= 2;
    });
    return messages;
  },

  author: function () {
    var discussion = Zorbs.findOne(Session.get('discussionId'));
    return Meteor.users.findOne(discussion.author);
  }
});
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>A Case for JavaScript</h3>

      <p>If you have any programming experience, you likely have an opinion about JavaScript. Here is why we chose to teach JavaScript over other languages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript can run no matter the operating system as long as a browser is installed.</li>
        <li>Everything is an object.</li>
        <li>Extremely flexible, can emulate syntaxes from many languages.</li>
        <li>Weak typed programming languages are typically easier for beginners.</li>
        <li>Constantly being updated (ES2015, ES2016).</li>
        <li>Node.js is awesome.</li>
        <li><strong>HUGE</strong> community of open source libraries (NPM).</li>
        <li>It's fun (opinion).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More important then the language is we will be teaching you how to <em>think</em> like a computer scientist. After that you should have the tools to go and learn whatever language you want.</p>

      <h2>Now for some yummy backend</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Client code</h3>

      <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the files that get rendered in the browser, the "<em>client</em>".</p>

      <p>Because they are sent to your browser, anyone can see the code you write. Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=the+computer+science+club+is+awesome!">Google</a> and open the DevTools.</p>

      <p>View the source with whatever browser you are using, you can see <em>everything</em>! You could literally copy all that code into a file and have your own Google! Right? <strong>Wrong</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Server code</h3>

      <p>Because anyone can see your "client" code, it is not secure. Anyone can change any value anytime. The changes just won't be seen by anyone else.</p>

      <p>People can't see your server side code however.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h4>Server as a Waiter</h4>

      <p>Imagine the server as your waiter at a resturaunt. The server is what gives you your "cake" of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</p>

      <p>The client (browser) and the server communicate through another web technology HTTP.</p>

      <h2>Put it all together...</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>I click another cat link as I often do @ <code>http://cats.cute/kitten</code></li>
        <li>The browser makes an <strong>HTTP</strong> request to the <strong>Server</strong> living at <code>http://cats.cute/kitten</code></li>
        <li>The <strong>Server</strong> sends an <strong>HTTP</strong> response <em>back</em> to the browser with the <strong>HTML</strong> of the page</li>
        <li>The <strong>HTML</strong> is recieved by the browser and parsed</li>
        <li>Links to the <strong>CSS</strong> (<code>http://cats.com/styles.css</code>) and <strong>Javascript</strong> (<code>http://cats.cute/scripts.js</code>) in the <strong>HTML</strong> are retrieved through more <strong>HTTP</strong> requests to the <strong>Server</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong>CSS</strong> is applied to the <strong>HTML</strong> making the page look pretty</li>
        <li>The <strong>JavaScript</strong> is executed on the <strong>HTML</strong> page, giving it functionality and making the cats go "<em>Meow!</em>"</li>
